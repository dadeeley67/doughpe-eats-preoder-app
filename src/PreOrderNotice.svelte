        What's up, y'all. This site exists to make my life easier each Saturday,
        and so that as many of you get what you want as possible. The way this
        pre-order form works is as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is no option to set a pickup time. When you pre-order bagels,
          that just means I will set them aside for you and prepare them for you
          when you arrive.
        </li>
        <li>
          I won't have many loaves of bread available without a pre-order. It
          isn't as easy for me to gauge how many loaves people will buy, so
          unless you pre-order, I'll probably run out of bread before you get
          here.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you've submitted your order, you will be redirected to a page to
          pay for your order. You'll recieve a confirmation email with a link to
          your order. If you don't recieve an email, please check your spam
          folder.
        </li>
      </ul>
